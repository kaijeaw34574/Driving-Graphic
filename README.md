# Driving Graphics

This project was inspired by my desire to learn how to program a simulation of the movement of objects. I have applied still images of the car in various ways to be used in programming to show that the car looks like moving along the road.

### Feature
  1. Press the "Enter" to drive or stop the car.
  2. Press the "W" to turn on-off the car's headlights.
